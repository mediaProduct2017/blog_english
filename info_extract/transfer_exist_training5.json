Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).",

If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish.",

On the other hand ```null``` is actually an object reference even though you may at first believe otherwise. This is the reason ```typeof null``` returns ```&quot;object&quot;```.\nFunctions in JavaScript are similar to functables in Lua (i.e. they are callable objects). Hence a function can be used in place of an object. Similarly arrays are also objects in JavaScript. On the other hand objects can be thought of as associative arrays.\nThe most important point however is that there are no classes in JavaScript because JavaScript is a prototypal object oriented language. This means that objects in JavaScript directly inherit from other objects. Hence we don't need classes. All we need is a way to create and extend objects.\n",

For the distance, you need accurate parallactic measurement, which come in with your orbital period.\nFor a typical Gaia-star with several measurement per year, you'll get 5 values of the parallax after 5 years of time, which you then average. If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5/168 th of one paralactic measurement.\nIt simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways.

The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future.",

This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute.

For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. \nLeft to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed.

Then the internal angle bisectors of the vertices intersect at four points $WXYZ$, which are the vertices of a rectangle.\n\n(You need the condition that $ABCD$ is not a square because if it is a square then all four angle bisectors coincide at a single point.)\nHere are a few ways to strengthen the theorem:\n\n* The hypothesis \"$ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle\" can be relaxed to the more general \"$ABCD$ is a (non-rhombic) parallelogram\".  The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\n",

Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Here's a brief overview to get you started. Hopefully this helps!\n\n* 'Gain' controls are typically used to get a good input level. So for example if you had a microphone with a very low output signal, you would boost the gain to get a better level into your mixing desk or audio interface. If you had a synthesizer plugged in you might need to turn the gain down to stop the signal distorting. Gain controls are often controlling an amplifier behind the scenes - i.e. your signal can 'gain' strength after going through the gain stage of your audio equipment. So gain is usually the first control in the signal path of your recording equipment. \n\n* 'Volume' controls on the other hand tend to be at the end of the signal chain and are more likely to be attenuating rather than amplifying the signal. So on a mixing desk, having got a good level from each input at the gain stage, you use the volume faders to adjust the relative volumes of each channel to achieve a good mix. You are not typically amplifying those signals any more though.\n\nA guitar amp is a good example of how this works. The first control is often called \"Gain\" or 'drive' and guitarists often deliberately turn this really high to get a nice distorted sound from a tube preamp. However, the final control is called Volume and governs simply how loud the sound coming out of your speaker is. With gain right up and volume low you can play distorted sounds without annoying the neighbours. With gain low and volume high you get a loud sound but no distortion.",

The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have.

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are several benefits of using ```%s``` over ```+``` for string concatenation in Python:\n* Readability. The format string syntax is more readable, as it separates style from the data. Also, in Python, ```%s``` syntax will automatically coerce any non ```str``` types to ```str```; while concatenation only works with ```str```, and you can't concatenate ```str``` with ```int```.\n* Performance. In Python ```str``` is immutable, so the left and right string have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenation. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you will be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters, instead of just 40 characters. And things gets quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases. Java optimizes this case some of the times by transforming the series of concatenation to use ```StringBuilder```, but CPython doesn't.\n* For some use cases, the logging library provide an API that uses format string to create the log entry string lazily (```logging.info(\"blah: %s\", 4)```). This is great for improved performance if the logging library decided that the current log entry will be discarded by a log filter, so it doesn't need to format the string.\n",

First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity.

As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard.

Both are designed to address a problem of asynchronous programming, however their approach to solution is very different:\n\n* Rx comes with a particular functional style of programming that can be implemented in virtually any programming language without support from the language itself. It works well when the problem at hand easily decomposes into a sequence of standard operators and not so well otherwise.\n* Kotlin coroutines provide a language feature that let library writers implement various asynchronous programming styles, including, but not limited to functional reactive style (Rx). With Kotlin coroutines you can also write your asynchronous code in imperative style, in promise/futures-based style, in actor-style, etc. \n\nIt is more appropriate to compare Rx with some specific libraries that are implemented based on Kotlin coroutines. \nTake kotlinx.coroutines library as one example. This library provides a set of primitives like ```async/await``` and channels that are typically baked into other programming languages. It also has support for light-weight future-less actors. You can read more in the Guide to kotlinx.coroutines by example.\nChannels provided by ```kotlinx.coroutines``` can replace or augment Rx in certain use-cases.

Parkes says:\n\n  Breath‐holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath‐hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath‐holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath‐holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15",

That would indeed impart an opposite torque for short lengths of time. However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction. Therefore, to counter that torque, the reaction wheel would have to accelerated uniformly and indefinitely. Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan). So either that angular momentum is the spinning of the helicopter's body (which is what we're trying to avoid) or that of the reaction wheel, whose angular momentum must be steadily increasing under the action of the angular impulse to the system.",

In his words, he \"neglected etymological rules\". \n\nIn that same year, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science began developing a coherent system of electrical units, the cgs system. Varley, a committee member, liked Clark's proposal, but he advocated adding a French name such as Ampere, to facilitate the international acceptance of the new units (\"I should like to introduce a French name into the list. We have Germany, England and Italy represented\"). For the same reason he may have pleaded for not distorting the French and German names. In addition, Varley objected to the galvat \"because Galvani discovered next to nothing\".\n\nLatimer Clark adapted the unit names in his 'Elementary treatise on electrical measurement' (1868). He changed ohma to ohm, and dropped the galvat. Maxwell acknowledged Clark's practical units and their names in his 'Treatise on electricity and magnetism' (1873). In 1881, at the International Electrical Congress in Paris), two French names, ampere and coulomb, were added. The diplomacy worked, and the new system of electrical units was adopted by all countries. The only units that kept the initial name distortion were the volt and the farad.",

These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$.

This means that the class adheres to the open-closed design principle (OCP): the class is closed for changes in what states/types there are, but the states/types are open to extensions.\n* By using the Strategy pattern the algorithm-using (context) class is relieved from knowledge of how to perform a certain task (-- the \"algorithm\").

A bike with more a more upright body position, a more stable weight distribution, a lighter frame, and far, far lighter wheels, is a more efficient choice for that style of ride.\n\nSecondly, a TT bike sacrifices bike handling for that extreme power and aero efficiency. The TT stages are controlled events, where there are either one rider, or one team on the course at a time, and so limitations on stability and handling are acceptable. Take the same bike in a 150 rider peloton, where riders constantly jockey for position, and where even on a stable bike losing focus for 1 second can cause a major crash, and all of a sudden, those same sacrifices in bike handling and stability are no longer a benefit for the rider or the team.

But since we've got a spare letter lying around—the English letter \"Q\" is actually related to the Arabic letter ق, if you go back far enough!—it's become conventional to separate them in writing. \"Kuwait\" is spelled with a ك, so it gets a \"K\"; \"Qatar\" is spelled with a ق, so it gets a \"Q\".

The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs.",

The lights are usually adjusted at dusk, night or dawn to match the exterior environment.\n\nIf the cabin lights do not fail during an emergency, the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the \"EXIT\" signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow. The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed, saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated.\n\nThis also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows. The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation, however, with a darker cabin, any outside light source, especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew, making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster, e.g. fire on port side --> no evacuation on that side.\n\nThe blinds are therefore raised to allow a better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts, such as engines, wings, etc.",

Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage.

This reason for traveling at night is common for many hunters in the animal kingdom (and sometimes also their prey), has been used by humans in insecure or hostile territory for centuries and remains a standard technique for some military operations even today. \n\n2. Evading the elements: Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.\n\n3. Boosting morale: When conditions get worse (cold, moisture), getting up during the night and starting to hike will not only make you feel warm again, it will also boost your morale. Being active, and actively coping with a bad situation rather than staying miserable in the tent for the rest of the night will make you feel better.\n\n4. You want to avoid tourists: No, seriously, this is a real case in point. Most people travel during the day and one of the reasons we (or at least, I) get outdoors is to enjoy some quietness in the wild. Depending where you are, hiking at night is your best bet to fulfill this dream.\n\n5. Navigation (only very theoretical): Consider a situation where it is all cloudy during the day (so you do not see the sun), you lack a compass and currently have no sense of direction: if you are capable of navigating with the stars, you might consider waiting until dark and hope that the sky will clear up until then.

        "output": "Anycast is networking technique where the same IP prefix is advertised from multiple locations. The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests.

Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes.",

Evaporation — As the initially warmer water cools to the initial temperature of the initially cooler water, it may lose significant amounts of water to evaporation. The reduced mass will make it easier for the water to cool and freeze. Then the initially warmer water can freeze before the initially cooler water, but will make less ice.\n2.

You, the tree outside and everything else made of carbon is right now undergoing continuous combustion. However, in the absence of catalyst, this process is too slow below a couple hundred degrees Celsius for it to be self-sustaining. More technically, combustion of organic matter is a highly exergonic process, but the activation energy is high. The meagre amount of heat generated by the handful of molecules reacting is too quickly diluted into the surroundings, and the reaction does not accelerate and spiral out of control (a fire, as described by the eternal Feynman).\n\nVery luckily for us, Life figured out this vast untapped source of chemical energy held back by kinetics approximately three billion years ago and developed a whole metabolic process to extract this energy in a stepwise fashion using catalysis, which we call aerobic respiration.

At that point, the title was Snipe (as in \"Sniper\"). Right before he started drawing, he began to think that a sword would be better and realized he couldn't use Snipe as a title anymore. He began looking for a title that grasped the bigger picture. Shinigami are associated with the color black, but it would have been boring to use \"black\". \"White\", on the other hand, can suggest black as a complementary color. So Tite Kubo chose \"Bleach\" to evoke the impression of the color white.\n\nThere are also other theories, which aren't as well supported by interviews with Kubo but still seem to have some evidence supporting them. One is that shinigami \"cleanse\" souls, similar to what bleach does (Kubo himself mentioned this in an interview, but it's not clear whether he noticed this before or after deciding on the name). Another is that Kubo is a fan of the band Nirvana, and their first album is Bleach. So there might be more than one reason, but the quoted one above is the one he usually gives when asked about it.",

They're also not good for driving into something very soft–between the hammer strikes there's no torque applied and the bit can actually rotate backwards. You can see this by holding the chuck with your hands while the driver is on; you'll feel the pulsing of the strikes but chuck won't actually rotate.

First, we define the data to write to the CSV as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the CSV file. We then open a file with the write mode (`w`), and create a csv.writer object to write data to the CSV file. Finally, we use the writerows() method to write the entire list of lists (i.e. data) to the CSV file. The newline='' parameter is used to prevent extra newlines from being written to the file.",

The focus on testing is harmful in so many ways. It encourages teaching to the test and rote learning. It leads to gaming the system by teachers and students. It leads to a narrowing of the curriculum as schools focus on the subjects that are tested. It discriminates against kids who aren't good at taking tests, especially kids with ADHD, dyslexia and other learning disabilities. There needs to be more evaluation of critical thinking and reasoning skills, and less emphasis on memorization and regurgitation. \n*  Enhance teacher training and support. I would make teacher education more rigorous, with more emphasis on pedagogy and less on content. A good teacher does not need to know all the answers, but needs to know how to find the answers, and how to inspire and guide students. In addition, I would make it compulsory for teachers to keep updating their knowledge of both their subject and of teaching methods. \n*  Increase government fundings for teacher training. I would invest heavily in teacher training and professional development and ensure that teachers are well supported, respected and fairly paid.<\\lit>\n*  Introduce a course on logical fallacies, starting with the most basic ones like appeal to authority, ad hominem, red herring, tu quoque, appeal to tradition, appeal to emotion, etc. I would also introduce a course on critical thinking, which would be more practical than the previous one. Students would learn how to formulate arguments and evaluate them, how to distinguish between good and bad arguments, etc.\n*  Ensure that students receive a balanced curriculum including the arts, humanities and sciences. Schools should be evaluated on how well they develop the whole student, including their social, emotional and physical wellbeing.<\\lit>",

For example, France is a semi-presidential democracy, where the president is elected directly by the citizens, but the government and prime minister are voted in by the parliament.\n\n*  In a parliamentary democracy, the government is responsible to the legislature, aligning the executive and legislative branches. Many parliamentary democracies elect their head of state via the legislature, while others, such as the United Kingdom, have a hereditary head of state.",

A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.\n* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult.

In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well. These people, while rare, do not have brains that are symmetrical, but have developed connections between the two hemispheres that allow them to access both motor cortices.\nThe genetics of handedness are complex and not well understood. There does appear to be a genetic component, but it is not straightforward. Identical twins who are brought up in the same environment are not always both left or right handed, suggesting that environmental factors also play a role.\nOne of the most interesting things about handedness is how early it becomes apparent. Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness, and it is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time.

You can try to do this when you create a lesson plan to keep the students engaged:\n\n* Have clear objectives for each lesson and making sure to review these objectives before starting the lesson (this helps students know what is expected of them)\n* Have variety of activities to help students practice the skills being learned (this helps students with different learning styles practice the skills)\n* Have some flexibility in how the activities are completed (this helps students with different learning styles complete the activities in a way that works for them)\n* Have some extra help time built into the lesson to allow students to ask questions and receive extra help if needed (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n* Give students opportunities to work with each other to practice the skills (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n* Provide extra practice outside of class (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n\nI hope this helps!",

A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep, sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors.\n\nSleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation.

You may have had valid reasons for not sharing this information with your girlfriend earlier, such as respecting your parents’ privacy and not finding a good time to bring this up. \n*  Your girlfriend’s expectation. Depending on the level of closeness in your relationship, your girlfriend may expect certain levels of openness and honesty. If you have been in a higher level of intimacy, she may expect you to share your personal information including your family status with her. She may feel deceived or hurt if she discovers that you withheld information about your parents’ sexual orientation. \n*  Your girlfriend’s attitude towards LGBTQ+. If your girlfriend is supportive of the LGBTQ+ group, she may feel uncomfortable with your non-disclosure of your parents’ sexual orientation, as she might feel her values were questioned and you failed to respect her values. \n*  Reflection on your motivation.  Take a moment to reflect on your motivations of not disclosing your parents’ sexual orientations to your girlfriend. Did you hide from her intentionally? Or were you worried about your girlfriend’s reactions to your disclosure? Reflecting on your intentions will help you better understand how your actions may have affected your relationship. \n\nTo sum up, while it’s up to you to decide what information you want to share with your partner, understanding the dynamics of your relationship and reflecting on how the situation developed is important. It is normal for relationships to experience conflicts because it often serves as a learning curve for both parties.

        "input": "",
        "output": "It is important to understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to your question. Every relationship is different, and there is no single way to define a \"healthy\" relationship.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that you can use. One of the most important things to remember is that a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Here are some suggestions to improve your public speaking skills.\n\nThe first thing you must do is to accept that it's normal to be nervous. Even the most seasoned public speakers still get nervous before giving a big presentation. The difference is that they have learned to control their nervousness and even use it to their advantage.\n\nSecond, you need to realize that people aren't actually out to judge and criticize you. They actually want you to be good. They want to be entertained, informed, enlightened - whatever the goal of your speech is, they want you to achieve it. When you give a speech, you and the audience have the same goal - for you to be good. So don't think that people are out to get you.\n\nThird, what you must do is to practice, practice, practice. There is no substitute for this. When you first start out, you'll be nervous even when giving a speech in front of just one other person. That's fine. Just keep practicing and you'll get better.\n\nLast, you need to learn the art of storytelling. This is a powerful technique that will help you engage your audience and keep them interested in what you have to say. Stories are powerful because everyone likes to hear stories. Even if your speech has nothing to do with stories, you can still use storytelling techniques to make it more interesting. For example, you can start your speech by telling a brief story about something relevant to your speech. Or you can use stories as illustrations or examples when explaining points in your speech.",

Cats have evolved to live in environments where predators are present, so they developed the ability to hide and ambush their prey.\n* The cat can see the surroundings through the hole in the box.\n* If the cat has kittens, it can put the kittens in the box for safety.\n* Cats like to play, and a box can be a fun toy. Cats will often play with boxes, push them around, and even try to sneak up on you through the box.\n* Boxes are generally easy to get into, so the cat can come out of it quickly.\n* Boxes are generally quite cozy for the cat to be in, because they are mostly made of cardboard, which is a very soft material.",

Some common causes of insomnia are:\n\n* Sleep deprivation\n* Stress\n* Mental health issues (anxiety, depression, etc.)\n* Medications (both prescription and over-the-counter)\n* Environmental factors (noise, light, temperature, etc.)\n\nHere are a few things that might be helpful when you have trouble sleeping.\n\n* Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime.\n* Avoid stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol) at least 4-6 hours before bed. Caffeine and nicotine will keep you awake, and alcohol can cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep.\n* Keep your room as dark and as quiet as possible.\n* Establish a regular bedtime and wake time, and stick to it as much as possible.\n* Meditate before bed to reduce stress and anxiety.\n* Avoid looking at bright screens (computers, phones, tablets, etc.) right before bed. Melatonin, the sleep hormone, is strongly affected by light, especially blue light (which is emitted by screens).\n* Relax and wind down before bed. Read a book, have a glass of milk, do some yoga, or do some light stretching.\n* Avoid eating heavy meals right before bed.\n* Get exposure to bright light (sunlight or a bright light box) in the morning.\n\nIf none of these techniques help you sleep, or if you have trouble sleeping for more than a few weeks, you should see a doctor.  Insomnia can be a symptom of a serious underlying medical condition, and you should get it checked out.",

        "output": "Here are some suggestions for your circumstance where your partner is reluctant to talk when you have a quarrel.\n\nFirst, ask yourself why you want your partner to talk when they don't want to. It is natural and healthy for people to need different amounts of time and space to process their emotions. If your partner is the type who needs a lot of time and space, pushing them to talk before they're ready will simply prolong the quarrel. You may very well be sabotaging yourself here.\n\nSecond, remember that you are not a mind-reader. You may think your partner is refusing to talk to you as a form of punishment, or to gain leverage in the argument, or any number of other reasons. But the only way to know why they are doing it is to ask them. You may not get a satisfying answer, but anything you learn will be better than the guesses you are making now.\n\nThird, if you are certain that your partner is simply trying to &quot;win&quot; the argument by refusing to engage, you have two options: you can withdraw from the argument, or you can engage anyway. If you withdraw, you may be giving up on something you want, but you also avoid the conflict escalating further. If you engage anyway, you may be able to convince your partner (or yourself) that you are serious about the issue at hand, and that it is worth discussing.

Paleontologists would fight tooth and claw to be the first to study them. The island would be immediately declared a nature preserve and probably a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The country that owns the island (if it's a country that has a good relationship with the scientific community) would be overjoyed at all the scientific attention and would do everything they could to help the scientists study the dinosaurs.\n\nSecond, the public would also go nuts. It would get a lot of media coverage. There would be huge demand for tours to the island, as much to see the dinosaurs as to see the amazing new species of plants and other animals that would almost certainly be found there as well. The country that owns the island would be overjoyed at all the income from tourists and would do everything they could to set up tours, as long as the scientists didn't object too strongly.\n\nThird, there'd be a lot of debates about whether to clone them, whether it was ethical to bring them back to civilization and what impacts they would have on the ecosystem and society.\n\nOverall, the discovery of live dinosours is a momentous event and it needs lots of discussions and careful actions to figure out what is the best way to manage the dinosours.",

Nod your head, say \"mm-hmm\" and apologize. \"I'm sorry you're having this experience\" or \"I understand your frustration\" work well.\n\nEmpathize\nTry to understand the cause of the frustration and express that understanding. \"I understand that you were expecting your package yesterday and you're frustrated that it hasn't arrived yet.\"\n\nProvide a solution\nNow that the customer has had their say and feels understood, it's time to solve the problem. If you're able to provide a solution that will make them happy, do so. \"I'd be happy to reship your order\" or \"I can refund your purchase right now\" are great ways to end a frustrating situation on a positive note.\n\nFollow up\nDepending on the situation, it may be appropriate to follow up with the customer after the fact. A quick email to check in and make sure they received their refund or replacement order can go a long way toward building trust and repairing any damage done by the initial problem.",

        "output": "Here are some examples of jobs that may become fully automated by the 2030's:\n\n*  Truck Drivers. With the current pace of advances in AI, we may see more and more semi-autonomous and even fully-autonomous vehicles on the road over the next few years. As of 2021, there are about 3.5 million truck drivers in the US alone, many of which may be replaced by fully-autonomous trucks by 2030.\n\n*  Customer Service Representatives. As of the early 2020's, text and voice-based chatbots are already supplementing agents in call centers. This trend is expected to grow exponentially, especially with the recent surge in large language models, to a point where only a handful of human representatives may be needed to assist with extreme cases.\n\n*  Professional Translators. Machine translation is already commoditized via Google Translate and similar products. As this technology becomes more robust, it is easy to imagine official documents and even novels being translated into dozens of languages at a flip of a switch.\n\nIt is important to remember that these suggestions are speculative, since technological advances and their impact on society are hard to predict.",

Here is a ballpark estimate of how much a team night out in a large city in the United States is likely to cost.\n\nRestaurant: Dinner per person can vary a lot, depending on location, the type of cuisine, and whether or not alcohol is included. Assuming a high-quality American restaurant that is not too fancy and moderate amounts of alcohol, a reasonable estimate would be around $80 per person, including tip. In total, this component will likely cost around $560.\n\nShow: Tickets to shows typically cost between $50 and $150, depending on the show. Let's estimate this cost at $100 per person. For 7 team members, this amounts to $700.\n\nTransportation: There may be additional transportation expenses such as taxis or parking. For a party of 7, we can assume two taxis over three legs (office to restaurant, restaurant to show, show to office). Assuming each drive will cost around $15, we arrive at a global cost of $90 for transportation.\n\nIn total, the planned team night is likely to cost approximately $1,350.

Since Probabilities are bounded by $1$, this inequality is poor when $pe^{-x^2} \\gt 1$, or equivalently $x \\lt \\sqrt{\\log(p)}$.

While the advancement of science might have enabled hand-made instances of motorized vehicles for very wealthy individuals, the main mode of transportation for people would have remained foot, horse, or sail. \n\n*  Communication: The Industrial Revolution enabled the creation of power and communication infrastructures, which would not exist in an unindustrialized world, forcing people to communicate slowly via physical transportation of messages. \n\n*  Agriculture: Our timeline's population boom is supported by the ability to mass produce food. In an unindustrialized world, supporting a large global population would be impossible, and there would likely be substantially less humans alive than there are today. \n\n*  Education: Industrialization incentivized public education systems.

Make sure your heart is good, and that you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent you from exercising.\n* Start slow. If you haven't exercised in a long time, your body isn't going to be able to handle a lot. Start with walking. Do some basic stretches (don't stretch too much, it's actually bad for you if you haven't warmed up). Walk for 15-20 minutes a day, and do some light stretches (no bending over touching your toes type stuff).\n* Make a plan. Saying \"I'm going to exercise\" is pretty vague. Write down what you plan to do, and when. If you're going to lift weights, write down which exercises you're going to do, and how many sets and reps. If you're going to run, write down your route, and how long it usually takes you. Having a plan will help you track your progress, and keep you motivated.\n* Don't overdo it. If you're just starting out, twice a week is good. You need rest to build muscle, so don't be afraid to take a day off between workouts. You can always increase the frequency as you go.\n* Make it a habit. This is important. After a while, your workout schedule should become a habit, like brushing your teeth. This will keep you going in the long run.\n* Don't be discouraged by lack of progress at first. It takes a while for results to show, especially if you're starting from zero.

But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface.\n\nBecause I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in hundreds, thousands of years. Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky. Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up- but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever.\n\nThat is desolate.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse.",

Learning a foreign language helps with things like creativity, multitasking, and problem-solving skills. \n\n*  It helps you meet new people. Whichever language(s) you choose to learn, you’re giving yourself the opportunity to meet and interact with new people. Whether it’s through a language course, learning app, or on your travels, you’ll be able to communicate with people who don’t necessarily share your native tongue. \n\n*  It helps cultural understanding.

On the other hand, you don’t want to destroy your family relationship with your sister especially when she is in great need. If you have a very close relationship with her and her husband, it’s reasonable that you make the decision of using your savings to help them. However, it would also be wise to seek advice from professionals and trusted family members before making any decisions about how to spend your money.\n \n\nIn conclusion, the decision is ultimately yours to make and it should be based on what you believe will have a positive impact on your future plans. It’s important to have open and honest conversations with your sister and her husband about your decision and concerns.",

The Buddhist kingdom is the only carbon-negative country on Earth, with strict environmental laws and cultural norms that preserve its stunning natural landscape. For similar reasons, Bhutan was one of the last countries to introduce television in 1999, and has no traffic lights to this day.\n\n*  There are currently few territories on Earth that are unclaimed by any sovereign state (terra nullius). One example is Bir Tawil, along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1902. The territory remains unclaimed by either country, because it would entail forfeiting the much larger Halaib Triangle, which is claimed by both countries. Bir Tawil has no settled population, but the land is used by Bedouins who roam the area.\n\n*  The antipode of any spot on Earth is the point on Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it. Some interesting approximate antipodes include pairs of capital cities, such as Wellington (New Zealand) - Mardrid (Spain), and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) - Lima (Peru).",

        "output": "Building a good family relationship is very important for people of all ages. A good family relationship can help children grow up to be well-adjusted adults and can help adults maintain a healthy lifestyle. One of the most important things to do to build a good family relationship is to spend time together. Whether it is eating dinner together as a family or going on vacation, time spent together builds memories and strengthens the bond between family members. Another important thing to do is to be honest with one another. This means both telling the truth and being honest about one's feelings. Keeping secrets or hiding emotions can be very damaging to a family relationship.\n\nIn addition to spending time together and being honest, it is important for family members to support one another. This can mean helping each other out when times are tough or celebrating together when good things happen. It is also important to respect each other. Family members should respect each other's differences and opinions. This means not criticizing or judging one another. Family members should also take care of one another. This can mean helping out with chores or watching the kids so parents can have a night out, or it can mean taking an elderly relative to the doctor.\n\nTaking time to build a good family relationship is important, as family members will be there for one another throughout life. Children will learn how to have healthy relationships from their parents and other family members. Adults will have a strong support system to help them get through difficult times. Family members can also have fun together and make lifelong memories. While it may sometimes be difficult, it is important to put effort into building and maintaining a good family relationship.",

For example, the principle of innocent until proven guilty is rooted in Roman law. Additionally, the Romans made significant advances in engineering and architecture that are still used today. For instance, concrete was invented by the Romans, and it is still one of the most common building materials. Furthermore, many modern cities are built on Roman designs, with public spaces like squares and boulevards surrounded by buildings. In conclusion, ancient Rome had a profound impact on modern politics, law, technology, and culture, and its legacy continues to shape society today.",

It's usually because it wants to claw off old nail sheaths, or because it wants to mark its territory. Here are a number of things you can do to train her not to scratch your furniture.\n\nFirst, you can trim her nails regularly. If you trim your cat's nails regularly, then it will be less likely for her to want to scratch because it will be more uncomfortable for her to do so. Plus, it will reduce the damage done by scratching because the claws won't be as sharp.\n\nSecond, you can cover the areas with something unpleasant, like tin foil or double-sided tape. This should discourage her from scratching there, and she'll (hopefully) learn to go to her scratching post instead.\nThird, you can try to redirect her attention when she starts to scratch where she shouldn't. If you catch her in the act, make a loud noise (clapping is good) and she should stop. Then, if you have a scratching post nearby, encourage her to scratch there instead. Give her a treat if she scratches the post, or praise her verbally. She'll learn that scratching the post gets her good things, while scratching the furniture gets her nothing.\n\nFinally, you can try a combination of all of the above. Trim her nails, cover the furniture, and when you catch her scratching the furniture, clap your hands and show her the scratching post.\n\nWith consistent effort, you should be able to break her furniture-scratching habit. It may take a few weeks, but it can be done.\n",

Providing all citizens access to high-quality, free education allows for more equal opportunities for underprivileged individuals.\n\nHaving said that, there are also arguments against socialism and specific socialist policies.

Tires were meant to get dirty. But if you follow a few simple steps, you can cheat the rules and keep your tires looking clean.\n\n## Tire\n\n1. Spray a synthetic wheel cleaner onto dry tires and allow five minutes to set in and lift off grime.\n2. Rinse off cleaner with a hose, being sure to remove all traces of the cleaner.\n3. Examine the tires. If they are still not up to expectations, allow surface to dry and then repeat steps 1 and 2.\n4. Apply tire wetting formula to the walls of the tire. If it is spray on, simply let the foam work its way into the tires and dry. If using a gel, however, apply to an applicator sponge specialized for the purpose and apply as needed.\n\n\n## Non chrome rim\n\n1. Start with a basic cleaner . Windex will work fine.\n2. Spray liberally onto the surface off the rim and rub on with a paper towel, or preferable a micro-fiber cloth.\n3. Spray off with a hose.\n4. Repeat step 1.\n\n\n## Chrome rim\n\n1. Know that polishes may be used after the initial cleaner to create a mirror like finish. These usually cost from 1-5 dollars.\n2. Make sure that the rims are not in direct sunlight. Apply the polish to a micro-fiber cloth or specialized applicator sponge, and use on the surface of the rim.\n3. Allow the polish to dry to a haze, and then rub to a clean finish with a micro-fiber cloth.\n",

Humans are often seen baring their teeth at enemies and allies alike to assert dominance. The Human will also don a carefully chosen set of armor. Some sets are meant to beguile, others are meant to intimidate, still others are meant to appear non-threatening. The Humans are truly masters of manipulation.\nWe cannot trust these Humans.

When me and your mother first learned about you I was at my lowest; I had lost my parents, my promotion, and I had just been diagnosed. Then on top of all that I now had a child to worry about, I had no idea how I could provide for you when we could barely make ends meet as it was. I won't lie, the nine months leading up to your birth was one of the hardest and most stressful of my life, and my health suffered even more. But on the day you were born, and I got see you for the first time, I got to hold you. I have never been happier, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders, I was at peace. I have gone through a lot, been dragged down to dark places, felt like the world was against me, but I got to hold you.\nI want you to always remember, no matter how dark things seem to be, no matter how far you feel you have fallen, the night is always followed by dawn, and every valley is flanked by hills. Missing your life is my greatest regret, but I got to hold you, I got to see your beginning, and that is something I will always cherish.\n\nLove,\nDad",

He hated the idea of finding a soulmate though the strange and foreign messages on his body just as much as I did, so we stuck together in our rebelliousness. Weeks went by, and the messages we got from our \"soulmates\" came less and less. They faded, as the months Roy and I spent together went on. Eventually, they stopped altogether. Not once, in all those years we spent together did we ever wonder what happened to the ones who sent the messages. All we needed was each other.

Being the protagonist of this story is as much an absurd experience as it is a chore. If only you could write well enough to make me speak good. Well! Speak *well*, damn you!\nYou see what I mean?\nI don't understand your methodology with crafting my story! Where does it start? Where does it end? All you have written is this sub-tier letter from *me*, addressing you the *writer*, in another of your ridiculous monologue pieces! I mean, how do I, a fictional character, even *know* about your other monologue pieces? If only you took as much care crafting a decent story for me, as you seem to make me sound like a snide idiot!\nThere's not even a conflict for crying out loud! All this story is just me, writing this letter, just becuz you can! Utterly ridiculous, even for an amateur of your calibre. An amateur of your calibre ought to be ashamed of sharing a story like this, whatever that is!\nStop it! Stop projecting yourself on me this instant!\nIn conclusion, you should take greater care with your work, before you share this grand insult that is my story. Poorly told as it is, I expect it to be edited, corrected, and posted so that I sound less pretentious, less repetitive, less repetitive, and better spokn.\nSincerely,\n\nYour Character",
